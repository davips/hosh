Change meaning of -hosh. Now it is the additive inverse.
Rename multiplicative_component to power_component
Rename additive_decomposition to bad_additive_components
Rename additive_component to bad_additive_component
Add components() for Pseudo"decomposition" based on the hosh of the current id concatenated as bytes to a given component index
Support slices; hosh[-1] means 'reversed hosh' (this is not the inverse!) as we cannot define a component without more information.
Replace h.rev by the more robust cell-based scheme
Impl h.bits
